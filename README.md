# Etsy Top Tags Tool
![Example screenshot](Preview.png)

This is a simple Python program that generates the top tags based on repetition and value from a text file. The program reads in a text file containing word combinations and their corresponding values, calculates the count and value of each word in the combinations, assigns a score to each combination based on the count and value of its words, and displays the top phrases in the console or a GUI.
